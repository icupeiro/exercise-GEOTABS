    "Design of the borefield is one of the most delicate parts of GEOTABS buildings. If the borefield size is too small, it will lead to the eventual depletion of the ground source and consequentially to operational problems. If the borefield size is too large, the investment costs will jeopardize the feasibility of the installation. Several features such as the massive ground thermal inertia and thermal interference between the boreholes must be taken into account. Borefield thermal step-responses (also known as g-functions), characteristic for each borefield geometry and configuration, are typically used to predict the borefield fluid temperatures. An example of thermal response functions is given in Figure 3. It can be clearly seen that, as the compactness of the borefield increases (i.e., B/H decreases), the step-response is increased due to thermal interference between the holes. \n",

    "A simple method to size geothermal borefields is given by the ASHRAE equation. The equation is valid for geothermal boreholes connected in parallel with the building, which are the most common ones found in building applications. The equation relies on the temporal superposition properties of the borefield by applying three consecutive pulses representing the peak load (qh), the maximum monthly load (qm) and the yearly unbalance load (qy). These loads are applied during 4-6 hours, 1 month and the design period (typically between 10 and 25 years) respectively. The thermal response of the borefield fluid for these three loads must stay between the design fluid constraints, as is shown by Figure 4. These design fluid constraints can be dependent on the national legislation, but most often they are within 0 째C (for heating) and 18/35 째C (for passive/active cooling). The ASHRAE equation has been the subject of discussion for many years, with some modifications and contributions by several authors as a result. The most recent version in the literature is provided by Ahmadfard and Bernier [5]:\n",

    "The sign convention is positive when heat is injected into the ground and negative when heat is extracted from the ground. The larger borefield of the two cases should be selected. The effective borehole resistance $R_b$ is a parameter that depends on the borehole geometry, while the effective ground resistances $R_{gh}$, $R_{gm}$ and $R_{gy}$ depend on the thermal response of the borefield. Since this thermal response depends on the borefield length (and also the ground properties and the borefield configuration), an iterative process is required to calculate the borefield length. This iterative process has been implemented in this Notebook using a Python script. The hourly and yearly periods of the code are 6 hours and 20 years respectively. The code first calculates the size for one simple borehole, as if no interference occurs between the boreholes, to get a first estimate of the size. Then, a rectangular borefield configuration is constructed with an initial guess of 100 m per borehole and the code executes the iterative process. \n",
