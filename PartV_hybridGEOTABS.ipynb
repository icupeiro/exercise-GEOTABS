    "The hybrid GEOTABS concept aims to tackle some of the weaknesses of the GEOTABS concept. It adds a fast-reacting secondary emission and/or supply system (i) to assist the high-inertia TABS when load peaks occur in the building and (ii) to meet the individual comfort requirements of each zone by providing individual tuning. Additionally, the installation of a secondary system assists in eliminating the possible thermal imbalance of the geothermal borefield. Nevertheless, the integration of two different systems with two different time constants becomes challenging to control. \n",

What would be your choice? Why? Which load (hourly, monthly or yearly) has more effect on the borefield size?\n",
