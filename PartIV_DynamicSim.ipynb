    "Unfortunately, the COVID-19 situation has provoked a change of plans. Due to the technical difficulties that involve the installation of the software (Dymola) in an external machine outside of KU Leuven university network and the uncertainty on the system specifications of your own machines, we have decided to skip the first step. Another point I tried was to upload the model in a cloud-based platform, yet unsuccessfully. Instead, we will do some analysis and interpretation of the results of a year simulation of this integrated model.\n",
